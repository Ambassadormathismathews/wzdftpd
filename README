##### README for wzdFTPd
#####

General remarks:

* This is not a program for beginners
* This is a buggy program

Notes:
* If you want the internal sfv checker to work, archive files and sfv file
    must have same prefix


Installation:

* copy the config file and the executable in the install dir
* copy AT LEAST one backend in the same dir
* edit wzd.cfg
  The file is commented, you shouldn't need help - if you need, install serv-u
* run the .exe
* login for the first time FROM LOCALHOST, user/pass: wzdftpd and create users

HOOKS parameters:

* all: first parameter is event id
* all: second parameter is user context

* login: username
* logout: username
* file_preupload: username, filename
* file_postupload: username, filename
* site: command, args

MODULES:

* fct WZD_MODULE_INIT is called at module load
* fct WZD_MODULE_CLOSE is called at module unload
* struct hook_table contains pairs (event_id,hook_fct) to trap events
* fct WZD_MODULE_INIT is called _BEFORE_ registering hook_table

Troubleshooting:

* SHM (linux)
  If (this should never happend ;-) the daemon crashes and the shared memory is not freed, you'll have
  to delete share memory by hand, 3 solutions
    + run 'wzdftpd -d'
    + become the samer user as the daemon runs, and run: ipcrm shm `ipcs -m | grep 0x1331c0d3 |  awk '{print $2}'`
      ->> replace 0x1331c0d3 with your key if you changed in wzd.cfg <<-
    + become root and do the same thing
    ± reboot the machine :)

* LOGIN
  Q: Sometimes login seems to freeze, and some time later all seems to go normal
  A: This is probably to a DNS lookup - it can be very long if you specified many
    addresses il config file and in allowed ip/user.
