##### README for wzdFTPd
#####

General remarks:

* This is not a program for beginners
* This is a buggy program
* You won't have any support
* You won't get sources too

Notes:
* If you want the internal sfv checker to work, archive files and sfv file
    must have same prefix


Installation:

* copy the config file and the executable in the install dir
* copy AT LEAST one backend in the same dir
* edit wzd.cfg
  The file is commented, you shouldn't need help - if you need, install serv-u
* run the .exe
* login for the first time FROM LOCALHOST and create users

HOOKS parameters:

* all: first parameter is event id

* login: username
* logout: username
* file_preupload: username, filename
* file_postupload: username, filename

Troubleshooting:

* SHM (linux)
  If (this should never happend ;-) the daemon crashes and the shared memory is not freed, you'll have
  to delete share memory by hand, 2 solutions
    + become the samer user as the daemon runs, and run: ipcrm shm `ipcs -m | grep 0x1331c0d3 |  awk '{print $2}'`
      ->> replace 0x1331c0d3 with your key if you changed in wzd.cfg <<-
    + become root and do the same thing
    ± reboot the machine :)
