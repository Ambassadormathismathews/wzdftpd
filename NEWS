* user can now see its own home

But the big part is the addition of some new features:
* tcl: command putlog
* new command STAT to provide a fast way to list dir
* group tagline, cookie %grouptag
* do not search UTF-8 by default in configure

And finally some new cookies to access transfered files infos:
