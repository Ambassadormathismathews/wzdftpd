- if run with root uid (linux only), should bind then give up root rights
- problem with fork(): communication between parent/childs
    we can use pipes
- chown work only under linux - use groups & perms under windows
- As long as all clients will be forked, we can always use chroot for childs -
  and NOT for parent
