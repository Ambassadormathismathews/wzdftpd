- problem with fork(): communication between parent/childs
    we can use pipes
- We can't use the setuid() function, it needs real users. I'll try to use only dir permissions and chown
- chown work only under linux - use groups & perms under windows
- As long as all clients will be forked, we can always use chroot for childs -
  and NOT for parent
