- if run with root uid (linux only), should bind then give up root rights
- problem with fork(): communication between parent/childs
    we can use pipes
- chown work only under linux - use groups & perms under windows
- As long as all clients will be forked, we can always use chroot for childs -
  and NOT for parent

BACKEND:

if backend_storage is 0, the main prog will allocate shared memory for users
functions VALIDATE_LOGIN / VALIDATE_PASS / FIND_USER / FIND_GROUP of the
backend are now changed: the pointer the receive in param is filled
by the user list
e.g
int FCN_VALIDATE_PASS(const char *login, const char *pass, wzd_user_t * user)

if backend_storage == 1
  user is a pointer to an allocated memory zone, 
  and the backend will copy infos in this zone
  returns 0 if ok
else
  user is a pointer to the user list
  returns -1 if failed, the index else
