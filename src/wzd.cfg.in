##### VFS
# first char is delimiter

# if delimiter is |
# for windows you can either write

# sections are used to define local server properties
# format: section = name path path_filter
#   path is a regexp to specify to specify where the section is

##### CRON JOBS
# cronjobs are commands to execute periodically
# syntax: cronjob = minute hour day_of_month month day_of_week command
# each field is an integer, of *
# syntax is similar to *nix 'crontab' command (man 5 crontab), except
#  ranges are not supported (for now)
# command should be an absolute path (with args if needed)
# NOTE: if command produce output, it will be logged with level LEVEL_INFO

##### CUSTOM MESSAGES
# You can modify custom ftp replies here
# Define message like that if on one line:

# You can also use files to include messages:
#   message_num = +/path/to/file
# I STRONGLY recommend to leave messages 227 (pasv reply), 250 (cwd) untouched
# most interesting messages are:
#  220 (banner), 230 (welcome message), 221 (logout)
