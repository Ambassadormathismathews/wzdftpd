- winsock version: ctrl+c is not handled instantaneously, but only after an
  interruptible function is called in main loop (printf,login, etc)
 consequence: ctrl+c is only handled next time a client tries to log in

- openbsd: build fails with:
  wzd_misc.h:58: conflicting types for `inet_ntop'

  -> run 'touch src/wzd_init_lex.{c,h}'
  -> run 'touch src/wzd_init_lex.l'
  -> run 'make' again

- LIST / does not work when inside a directory:

lftp pollux@127.0.0.1:/vfs2> quote PWD
257 "/vfs2" is current directory
lftp pollux@127.0.0.1:/vfs2> ls /
lftp pollux@127.0.0.1:/vfs2> ls ..
drwxr-xr-x   2 pollux ftp          4096 Oct 19 16:50 vfs2
drwxr-xr-x   3 pollux ftp          4096 Oct 12 13:58 TEST-SFV
drwxr-xr-x   2 nobody ftp          4096 Oct 19 16:50 iSO

- If a vfs is defined with the same name than an existing dir, LIST will show
  both

- rename dir1/dirname dir2/ does not work,
  rename dir1/dirname dir2/dirname is ok - is it expected ?

- FreeBSD (at least 5.2): ./autogen.sh fails with error ltconfig: No such file or directory
  -> solution: this is a conflict in several libtool installation - install ONE version !

- FreeBSD: ./autogen.sh conplains it cannot find autoconf/libtool
  -> solution: go to /usr/local/bin and create symlinks autoconf -> autoconf257, libtool -> libtool15,
    libtoolize -> libtoolize15

- FreeBSD: listening to an IPv6 socket does NOT listen to the same IPv4 socket !
