# Sep, 25 2002
- mkdir now sets owner of new dir
- rmdir checks if dir is not empty (except the perms file) and removes the
    perm file before removing the dir
- added timeout check for data connection

# Sep, 23 2002
- complete rewrite of memory management for users / groups in main prog AND in backend
    lists will be stored in shared memory

#--- cvs commit
# Sep, 18 2002
- clear_read function is now non-blocking (it timeout > 0)
- tls_auth_cont is now non-blocking (TLS control connection)
- tls_read and tls_write have been changed to handle correctly
    non-blocking I/O - all tls fct are now subject to timeouts

- bugfix: small bug in do_site_backend fixed
- moved user ip checking from backend to main prog

# Sep, 16 2002
- some changes to have compatibility with intel c compiler (tested with v6.0.139)
    changes were mainly little corrections of warnings concerning signed / unsigned variables :)
- bugfix: fixed critical bug in wzd_data.c where if SSL was enabled data were sent crypted
    even if data connection was in clear (PROT C)
- added -V option (display version & build number)

#--- cvs commit
# Sep, 13 2002
- bugfix: fixed stupid critical bug where read & write functions were stored in mainConfig,
    so all clients shared these functions - even ssl ones.
- bugfix: forgot to add a \0 at end of file name in sfv_find_sfv

# Sep, 06 2002
- bugfix: fixed critical bug in data connection, message 150 was sent AFTER waiting
    the connection to be opened by client, must be BEFORE.
    Curiously the bug was only visible in ssl-data transfers.
- tls: tls_auth_data_cont changed to loop around SSL_accept
- SFV: no more trying to check sfv if sfv file not found or file not in sfv
- VFS: fixed bug when 2 vfs have same prefix, comparison stopped after first match
    (e.g: vfs and vfs2 were same dirs)

# Sep, 04 2002
- hooks: EVENT_PREUPLOAD, EVENT_POSTUPLOAD
- internal SFV checker, checks file after upload

# Aug, 30 2002

- VFS: fixed permission problem if vpath not in user's rootpath
- site CHPASS user new_pass

# Aug, 19 2002
- first VFS implementation (Virtual FileSytem): path translation is ok,
   but if vfs destination is not in user's root, no access; vpath is not
   shown in 'ls' but is accessible by 'cd'

# Aug, 16 2002

# Aug, 12 2002
- site BACKEND close / init /reload back_name: low lovel function to
   manipulate the backend - mainly usefull for development (ability to
   compile / change backend without stopping server)
- many changes in plaintext backend: normalization of structs used,
   ability to write users file, new fields (tagline,ip_allowed,max_idle_time),
   bugfixes
- idle time checking (per user)
