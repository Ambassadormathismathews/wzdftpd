# Sep, 13 2002
- bugfix: fixed stupid critical bug where read & write functions were stored in mainConfig,
    so all clients shared these functions - even ssl ones.
- bugfix: forgot to add a \0 at end of file name in sfv_find_sfv

# Sep, 06 2002
- bugfix: fixed critical bug in data connection, message 150 was sent AFTER waiting
    the connection to be opened by client, must be BEFORE.
    Curiously the bug was only visible in ssl-data transfers.
- tls: tls_auth_data_cont changed to loop around SSL_accept
- SFV: no more trying to check sfv if sfv file not found or file not in sfv
- VFS: fixed bug when 2 vfs have same prefix, comparison stopped after first match
    (e.g: vfs and vfs2 were same dirs)

# Sep, 04 2002
- hooks: EVENT_PREUPLOAD, EVENT_POSTUPLOAD
- internal SFV checker, checks file after upload

# Aug, 30 2002
- Bugfix: changed strtol to strtoul where needed
- added SFV checking code (wzd_crc32.c), test ok

# Aug, 29 2002
- VFS: vpath is now visible in ls
- VFS: fixed permission problem if vpath not in user's rootpath
- site CHPASS user new_pass

# Aug, 19 2002
- first VFS implementation (Virtual FileSytem): path translation is ok,
   but if vfs destination is not in user's root, no access; vpath is not
   shown in 'ls' but is accessible by 'cd'

# Aug, 16 2002
- tag were renamed and seperated: myname/username, myip/userip, ...

   (forced to cast functions :(

- fixed bug in dynamic memory (wzd_ip_t structs)

# Aug, 12 2002
- site BACKEND close / init /reload back_name: low lovel function to
   manipulate the backend - mainly usefull for development (ability to
   compile / change backend without stopping server)
- many changes in plaintext backend: normalization of structs used,
   ability to write users file, new fields (tagline,ip_allowed,max_idle_time),
   bugfixes
- idle time checking (per user)

# Aug, 10 2002
- IP checking added in backend, to do after-login check (only allowed ip,
  default: reject

# Aug, 08 2002
