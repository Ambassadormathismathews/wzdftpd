This is a small set of directives for building wzdFTPd

Prerequisites:

Linux:
* a C compiler (tested with gcc-2.9x, gcc-3.1, gcc-3.2 and icc)
* if you want ssl support, openssl-devel headers and libs
* a lexical analyser generator (flex)

Windows:
* Cygwin, with gcc, make
* if you want ssl support, openssl-devel headers and libs


All paths are relative to rep wzdFTPd (root)

1)
Edit src/Makefile.config

2) If you have have a precent install, clean it by
make distclean

3) Build dependancies:
make deps

4) If you just copied files from cvs or similar, check symlinks:
make check_symlinks

5) Build executable and backends / modules
make release

6) Executable can be found in src
The _MINIMUM_ installation is composed of:
- the exe (wzdFTPd for linux, wzdFTPd.exe for win32)
- the lib (libwzd.so for linux, libwzd.dll for win32)
- the config file (wzd.cfg)
- ONE backend at least, with the backend's config files (libwzdplaintext.so, users)
- files used by site commands (see config file)

You can add modules

7) Restrictions:
+ The exe and the lib MUST be in the same dir (if you want to change this you need
  to change the src/Makefile, search for rpath
+ Backends and modules can be in separate dirs, you'll need to change config file
