<para>
  A cron job is a scheduled job, to be executed periodically or at a defined
time. Each second, the cron thread wakes up and examines all stored crontabs,
checking each command to see if it should be run.
</para>
<para>
  Commands are executed without any user context, so it can't be used to
interact with connected users. Any output will be stored in the standard log.
</para>
<para>
  <emphasis>NOTE</emphasis>: Cron jobs are executed in a separate thread, sharing
its memory with the server. This means that cron jobs must pay attention not to
cause classical threads problems (like modifying a linked list used by the
server without using mutexes) and not to overwrite the server's memory !
</para>

<para>As usual, cron jobs can be internal (functions written in C and added by
modules) or external (defined in config file).
