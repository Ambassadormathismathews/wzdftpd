  <title>How to report bugs</title>

  <para>Good bug reports are a very valuable contribution to the development of
any software project. But just like writing good software, good problem reports
involve some work. Please realize that most developers are extremely busy and
receive obscene amounts of email. So while your feedback is crucial in
improving wzdftpd and very much appreciated, please understand that you have to
provide all of the information we request and follow the instructions in this
document closely.

  <simplesect><title>How to fix bugs</title>
  <para>
    If you feel have the necessary skills you are invited to have a go at
fixing the bug yourself. The people on the
<ulink url="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/wzdftpd-devel">
wzdftpd-devel</ulink> mailing list will assist you if you have questions.
  </para>

  <simplesect><title id="howto_report_bugs">How to report bugs</title>
  <para>
    First of all please try the latest CVS version of wzdftpd as your bug might
already be fixed there. Development moves extremely fast, most problems in
official releases are reported within days or even hours, so please use
CVS to report bugs.
  </para>
  <para>
    Please do not send bug reports privately to individual developers. This is
community work and thus there might be several people interested in it.
Sometimes other users already experienced your troubles and know how to
circumvent a problem even if it is a bug in wzdftpd code.
  </para>
  <para>
    Please describe your problem in as much detail as possible. Do a little
detective work to narrow down the circumstances under which the problem occurs.
Does the bug only show up in certain situations? Is it specific to certain
files or file types? Does it occur with only one module or is it module
independent? Can you reproduce it with all backends? The more information
you provide the better are our chances at fixing your problem. Please do not
forget to also include the valuable information requested below, we will be
unable to properly diagnose your problem otherwise.

  <simplesect><title>What to report</title>
  <para>
    You may need to include log, configuration or sample files in your bug
report. If some of them are quite big then it is better to include a link
to a url where the files are accessible to the developpers.

  <simplesect><title id="crash">Crashes</title>
  <para>
    You have to run wzdftpd inside gdb and send us the complete output or if
you have a core dump of the crash you can extract useful information from the
Core file. Here's how:

  <formalpara><title>How to conserve information about a reproducible crash</title>
  <para>
  <screen></screen>
    Recompile wzdftpd with debugging code enabled:
  <screen>  ./configure --enable-debug
  make</screen>
    and then run wzdftpd within gdb using:
  <screen>  gdb wzdftpd</screen>
    You are now within gdb. Type:
  <screen>  run [options-to-wzdftpd]</screen>
    and reproduce your crash. As soon as you did it, gdb will return you to the
command line prompt where you have to enter 
  <screen>  bt</screen>
  </para>
  </formalpara>
  <formalpara><title>How to conserve information about a reproducible crash</title>
  <para>
  <screen></screen>
    Simply execute the following command on your command line:
  <screen>  gdb wzdftpd -core=core_file</screen>
    and enter:
  <screen>  bt</screen>
  </para>
  </formalpara>
  <formalpara><title>What to do with these infos ?</title>
  <para>
  <screen></screen> 
    Please attach the backtrace (what you obtained using the debugger) to
you bugreport. The core file is important, so do not delete it - do not
post it however, as core files are often large.
