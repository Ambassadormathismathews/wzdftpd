<title>Authentication</title>

<para>
wzdftpd supports several authentication methods, and all of them are common to all backends.
</para>

<para>
This section explains which methods wzdftpd can use. For the moment, you cannot easily
change auth method from SITE commands, but this will be implemented soon.
</para>

<sect1 id='auth_crypt'>
<title>Crypt</title>

<para>
The default method is to store password in crypt() format, which is a variation of the
Data Encryption Standard algorithm (DES) with variations.
</para>

<para>
To use the crypt format, the password is stored in backend encrypted. The first two chars
constitute the salt (it is use to perturb the algorithm).
</para>

<para>
Passwords stored in crypt format are limited to 8 characters.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id='auth_md5'>
<title>MD5</title>

<para>
Due to the limitations of the crypt format, and because it is a very common format on
linux systems, wzdftpd also supports the MD5 format.
</para>

<para>
To use the MD5 format, the password is stored with the special prefix "$1$".
The next characters (until "$") constitute the salt, and the remaining is
the encrypted password itself.
</para>

<para>
The MD5 format is used in the "shadow" file, for exemple. So you can just copy and paste
the encrypted password and it will work.
</para>

<sect1 id='auth_pam'>
<title>PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules)</title>

<para>
If pam was detected on your system during compilation, wzdftpd can try to authenticate
to the PAM subsystem by sending the login and password.
</para>

<para>
To use the PAM method, set the password to "{pam}"
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id='auth_cert'>
<title>SSL Certificates</title>

<para>
If the client is configurated to send a client certificate, the server can verify it
(you have to add the certificate authority in the config file, or the certificates
will be declared invalid).
</para>
