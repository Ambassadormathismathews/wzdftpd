<title>What is a SFV file ?</title>
<para>
A SFV file is a small verification file added to dirs, that stores records
about a file or group of files integrity. When you compare a SFV file against
a group of rar files it will check those rar files and tell you if they are
complete or if they are "broken".</para>
<para>
This is done by calculating a 32-bits checksum (*nix users already know
md5 sums, this is similar - with a different algorithm).
