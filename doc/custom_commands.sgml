<title>Adding SITE commands</title>

<para>
You can add SITE commands to the server, by defining a new command, calling
an external program when used.
They will be used exactly as other SITE commands.
</para>

<para>
If the command needs arguments you just have to specify them after the command.
You can use cookies in the arguments, they will be replaced as usual.
<screen>site_cmd = rescan /path/to/rescan.sh %username</screen>

<emphasis>NOTE: </emphasis>remember that SITE commands are not allowed by
default, so you must add a permission line in your config file, or your command
will not be accessible.

Please note that the return code of your command or program is important: a
return code of 0 means the command is successfull, other codes are reserved for
errors.
</para>
<para>For example, if you return a code different from 0 for the POSTDOWNLOAD or
POSTUPLOAD event, then the transfer will be denied.
