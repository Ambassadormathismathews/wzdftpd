##### CRON JOBS
# cronjobs are commands to execute periodically

# each field is an integer, of *
# syntax is similar to *nix 'crontab' command (man 5 crontab), except
#  ranges are not supported (for now)
# command should be an absolute path (with args if needed)

##### CUSTOM MESSAGES
# You can modify custom ftp replies here

# I STRONGLY recommend to leave messages 227 (pasv reply), 257 (pwd) untouched
# most interesting messages are:
#  220 (banner), 230 (welcome message), 221 (logout)

# you can use negations : !*
# REMEMBER that the FIRST corresponding rule is applied, so order is important (never put * first !)
