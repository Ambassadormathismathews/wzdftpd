0.7.0:

Some commands were moved to the [custom_commands] section: site groups, help,
swho, users, vfsls and who.
Juste convert 'sitefile_groups = /path/to/file' (in [GLOBAL]) to
'site_groups = !/path/to/file' (in [custom_commands]).

0.6.0:

The config file is changed, all directives must be put into sections. Until the
conversion script is ready, the easiest method is to use the default config
file and merge changes manually.

0.5.4:

MySQL backend: all tables renamed to lowercase. See UPGRADING file in
backends/mysql directory for upgrade instructions.

0.5.3:

New command 'site sections', add permissions to your .cfg:
- site_sections = +O

From 0.4.x to 0.5:

The server does no more use shm, so you can remove the 'shm_key' and
'force_shm_cleanup' in config file.
You may want to add 'logdir' in your config file.

Prefix '+' in front of ip addresses is no more needed in config file.

You should also restrict the new command 'SITE SU' to siteops:
-site_su = +O
