0.5.4:

MySQL backend: all tables renamed to lowercase. See UPGRADING file in
backends/mysql directory for upgrade instructions.

0.5.3:

New command 'site sections', add permissions to your .cfg:
- site_sections = +O

From 0.4.x to 0.5:

The server does no more use shm, so you can remove the 'shm_key' and
'force_shm_cleanup' in config file.
You may want to add 'logdir' in your config file.

Prefix '+' in front of ip addresses is no more needed in config file.

You should also restrict the new command 'SITE SU' to siteops:
-site_su = +O
