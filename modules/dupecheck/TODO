 * Allow for more extensive site dupe syntax
  - match filenames
  - match in a specific period range
 * Strip away the users ftproot from matches, and also only match the part after their ftproot.
 * Add configuration options for:
  - nocheckdirs
     dirs that are not checked for dupes when uploading files.
     files uploaded into these dirs are not added to the dupelog either
  - retentiontime
     how many days (?) to keep files in the dupelog, to keep the size manageable.
  - hidedirs
     dirs in this list will be added (and checked) for dupes, but the path
     of the file will not be added to the dupelog. this means that searching
     for the path yields no results, but the filename will still be matched
     on a dupecheck
 * Add site undupe (basically site dupe just with delete instead of select)
 * Configurable rights for site commands (dupe = anyone, undupe = +O?)
